# Information_Retrieval

Information retrieval is the science of searching for information in documents, searching for documents themselves, searching for meta-data which describe documents or searching within databases, whether relational stand-alone
databases or hypertextually-networked databases such as World Wide Web. An
Information Retrieval (IR) model selects and ranks the document that is required by the user or the user has asked for in the form of a query
In today’s world, information retrieval is used in almost every application from
searching for songs and movies to finding a book in a library catalog or searching for something or someone on the internet

An information retrieval system consists of the following components:
* Document Collection – the collection of documents over which any search is
performed
* Set of Queries – the queries on which the search is performed for retrieval;
* Indexing System – searching and indexing methods to retrieve an ordered
list of documents for every query;
* Evaluation Criteria – specified measures by which each system is evaluated,
for example ‘precision’ and ‘recall’ as measures of relevance
